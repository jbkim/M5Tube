Software Stack prerequisites
----------------------------
  - [M5Stack.h](https://github.com/m5stack/M5Stack/)
  - [M5StackUpdater](https://github.com/tobozo/M5Stack-SD-Updater/) and its [folder structure](https://github.com/tobozo/M5Stack-SD-Updater/releases)
  - [M5StackSAM](https://github.com/tomsuch/M5StackSAM/)
  - [ArduinoJson](https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson/)
  - [ESP8266Audio](https://github.com/earlephilhower/ESP8266Audio/)


Hardware Stack prerequisites
----------------------------
  - M5Stack
  - External DAC (e.g PCM5102) connected to the I2S
  - MicroSD Card

Installation
------------
  - either:
    1) create "/mp3", "/vid" and "/json" folders on the MicroSD Card 
    2) use the [SD-Apps-Folder](https://github.com/tobozo/M5Stack-SD-Updater/releases) folder structure from the M5Stack-SD-Updater
  - either:
    1) install docker and start the provided docker image
    2) install ffmpeg + imagemagick + php locally
  - run the script 'workflow.sh' to get your videos converted
  - when conversion is complete, choose between:
    1) having the container's working dir exposed by a web server
    2) copying the contents of /vid, /mp3 and /json folders from the 
       container's working dir to your MicroSD Card

Conversion settings
-------------------
  The conversion utily provided with this projects makes the process of converting the video to an acceptable format for the M5Stack much less painful.
  The mp4 format is required for the source file and audio is mandatory for the conversion to complete.
  After the audio is converted and recompressed to mp3 mono @32Kbps/22Khz, the video is split into frames, and each frame is split into 4 chunks.
  Only one of these 4 chunks is kept, converted into JPEG with variable compression rate, and stacked into a file.
  Custom conversion settings are available such as video width and processed chunks per second.

Player functionalities
----------------------
  - select video
  - play video
  - stop video
  - synchronize/download playlist
  - synchronize/download video/audio
  - load the [M5Stack-SD-Menu](https://github.com/tobozo/M5Stack-SD-Updater)

All videos are played from the SD and can't be paused (only stopped but PR's accepted).

The sync/download is optional but requires to have a web server handling TLS and exposing the video/audio/json files, some editing in the .ino file, and the gathering of the TLS certificate chain for certificates.h.

Any successful sync operation will overwrite the local files.

## 설치
- 동영상 변환을 위해서 ffmpeg과 imagemagick의 설치가 필요함.(brew로 설치 가능)
- 변환하고자 하는 파일은 video 폴더안에 .xxxxx.mp4 의 형태로 이름을 변경해서 카피해 놓는다.
~~~
  $ ./workflow.sh sample .sample.mp4
~~~  
- 이렇게 실행을 하면 frame 폴더에 변환된 파일이 저장이 된다. 이 파일들을 SD에 저장을 해서 M5Stack에 삽입하면 동영상 재생이 가능한다.
